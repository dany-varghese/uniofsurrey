# MACHINE LEARNING AND DATA MINING - 2019/0 

<c>Module code: COMM055</c>

Welcome to the Data Science Principles & Practices course, where you will explore the foundations of data science from theory to practice.

The module is structured into three sections. First section is led by Prof. Yaochu Jin to introduce you to data science, data munging and visualization.   Second section is led by Dr. Yunpeng Li to introduce Probability, statistical inference, hypothesis testing, and model building and testing. Final section is led by Dr. Yi-Zhe Song to introduce nearest distance, clustering, machine learning and its applications in Data science.  Labs & Tutorials will be led by Dr. Manal Helal. Tutorials will be Thursdays from 9 to 10 a.m. Lectures will be Thursdays 10-12. Labs will be on Thursdays 1-2.
All material supporting the course will be posted to this website, so please come here first to find what you are looking for.  This includes lecture slides, lecture recordings, lab sheets, supplementary material and links, coursework, and anything else we can think of. We will try to add discussion threads to every lab contents, such that you give us feedback on what is working with you, and any challenges faced such that we can address it together, and other students can benefit from what is posted.

In most labs we will be using python notebooks. You will need to download the lab documents to a folder of your choice. Run the Jupyter notebook server installed in the lab machines or your own. In the lab, the following is the command to use in terminal:

$ ~/.local/bin/jupyter notebook

if this is not in your system, install it:
Open the terminal window(Press Ctrl + Alt + T) and type following two commands one by one.

$ pip install --user jupyter
$ pip install --user notebook
(For more information, please visit: https://jupyter.org/install.)


Try again to run jupyter from your local profile, and it should work now. It will open this in your browser:
http://localhost:8888/ 
                                         or
Open the terminal and type  
              $ ~/.local/bin/jupyter notebook                                        
                                         
Interesting to know the following markup/down to format your text cells to generate interesting reports:

For any missing library, go back to terminal and install using the following command:

$ python -m pip install --user pandas

I have also added a github in which I will be adding all files of the labs, such that you can test in online servers and in github itself:

https://github.com/mhelal/COMM054/

For instance, you can go to :

https://nbviewer.jupyter.org/

and in the "Enter the location of a Jupyter Notebook to have it rendered here:" field, enter the first notebook as follows:

https://github.com/mhelal/COMM054/blob/master/lab1/lab1_PyIntro.ipynb

This will be a static viewer of the notebook. You can execute on the server by clicking on the second button from right on the top, that says "Execute in Binder". This will launch an interactive server for you.

We look forward to meeting you all on the course this semester.
